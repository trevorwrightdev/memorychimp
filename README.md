# memorychimp
Minimalist memorization site to test your memory!

# Synopsis
This is a website where people can play memory games. The first game I will be creating is the classic memory chimp game, where you must 
memorize the locations of boxes in a grid. Each box has a number. You must memorize the order of the boxes.

# Update Nov 17, 2021
I have made a working product. Here is some things I need to do now:
1. Make it look good on mobile
2. Refactor the code so the timer code is not repeated 
3. Make an actual losing menu instead of reloading the page.

# Options Menu
I need to add an options menu. Here are some of the features that will be included in it.
1. Color themes
2. Timer settings (if timer is set, game restarts. This is why having refactored code would be nice. A single function that can be called to start a game would be nice to have.)
